<p>Hello my name is Harshvardhan Bhausaheb Gaikwad and I’m excited to share a bit about myself.My hometown is Hupari which is located in District Kolhapur and Sub-district Hatkanange. I am second year student persuing Computer Science.I like coding because It is a creative and problem-solving skill that teaches the ability to break down complex problems into manageable parts, enabling individuals to create useful products, learn from non-repeating tasks, and face challenges. It can also open up new career opportunities and provide enjoyment in problem-solving and software building.</p>

  <h2><u>School</u></h2>
  <p>I have completed my Pre-Primary and Primary Education from Loksevak A.B.Naik Silver City English Medium School,Hupari.
  Many-sided things like stage daring,singing,participating in sports activities,MCC,showcasing our talents in art assesments such as Elementary and Intermidiate and many more things were carried out in our school rather than just Academics.
  We were aware of our cultural ethics and values as our school was arranging several acts on regional and international festivals.Silver City English Medium School is committed to providing quality education and holistic development for its students, making it a preferred choice for families in the Hupari area. </p>
